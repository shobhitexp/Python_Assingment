        "######Answer :- In delegation, the delegator class contains an instance of the delegate class and redirects method calls to the delegate, effectively \"delegating\" the responsibility of performing that action to the delegate object. This allows for more modular and flexible code, as changes to the delegate's implementation do not affect the delegator's behavior as long as the contract (interface) between the delegator and delegate is maintained."

They take an instance of their class along with the other arguments as its parameters. Bound methods differ from the other unbound methods in their first parameter."
