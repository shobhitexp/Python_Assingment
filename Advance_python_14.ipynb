        "\n",
        "1. **Wrapper:**\n",
        "   - A wrapper is a common programming concept where you create a new function or piece of code that \"wraps around\" or encapsulates another function or feature.\n",
        "   - Wrappers are often used for various purposes such as adding functionality, modifying behavior, or providing a common interface to multiple functions or components.\n",
        "   - Wrappers can be used in different contexts and may or may not be related to decorators or wrapped features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Wrapped Feature:**\n",
        "   - The \"wrapped feature\" typically refers to the original function or feature that you are encapsulating or augmenting with a wrapper.\n",
        "   - It's the core functionality or behavior that you want to build upon or modify using a wrapper.\n",
        "   - The wrapped feature is what the wrapper is designed to work with or extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Decorator:**\n",
        "   - A decorator is a specific type of wrapper commonly used in Python.\n",
        "   - Decorators are functions that take another function (or callable) as input, enhance or modify its behavior, and return a new function without permanently altering the original function's source code.\n",
        "   - They are often used for adding cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, or caching to functions.\n",
