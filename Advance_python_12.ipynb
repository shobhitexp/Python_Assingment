        "\n",
        "Answer :- In Python, you can index a character (or a substring) in a string using various methods. Here are the main ways to index a character within a string:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Positive Indexing**: You can use positive indices to access characters from the beginning of the string, starting from index 0.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "my_string = \"hello\"\n",
        "first_char = my_string[0]  # Retrieves the first character \"h\"\n",
        "second_char = my_string[1]  # Retrieves the second character \"e\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Negative Indexing**: You can use negative indices to access characters from the end of the string, starting from index -1.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "last_char = my_string[-1]  # Retrieves the last character \"o\"\n",
        "second_last_char = my_string[-2]  # Retrieves the second-to-last character \"l\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Slicing**: You can use slicing to extract a substring of characters from a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "substring = my_string[1:4]  # Retrieves characters from index 1 to 3: \"ell\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Striding with Slicing**: You can use striding to retrieve characters with a certain step size.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "every_second_char = my_string[::2]  # Retrieves characters at indices 0, 2, 4: \"hlo\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Using a Loop**: You can iterate through each character in a string using a loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "for char in my_string:\n",
        "    print(char)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Using `ord()` and `chr()` Functions**: You can use the `ord()` function to get the Unicode code point of a character and the `chr()` function to convert a Unicode code point back to a character.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "character = \"h\"\n",
        "unicode_code = ord(character)  # Gets the Unicode code point of \"h\"\n",
        "character_again = chr(unicode_code)  # Converts the Unicode code point back to \"h\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Indexing**:\n",
        "Indexing refers to accessing a single element within a sequence using its position or index. Indices are zero-based, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on. You can use both positive and negative indices to access elements from the beginning or the end of the sequence.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Slicing**:\n",
        "Slicing involves extracting a range of elements from a sequence. It's done by specifying a start index, an end index (exclusive), and an optional step size. Slicing returns a new sequence containing the specified range of elements.\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Relationship**:\n",
        "Slicing can be thought of as a generalized form of indexing. Indexing retrieves a single element at a specific position, while slicing retrieves a sequence of elements based on a specified range. Indexing is a special case of slicing where the range consists of a single index.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the examples above, when you index a string, you're essentially slicing it with a range that includes a single index. Slicing provides more flexibility by allowing you to extract multiple elements in one go. The slicing syntax is `start:end:step`, where `start` is the index of the first element to include, `end` is the index just after the last element to include, and `step` determines the stride or step size.\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, indexing and slicing are both ways to access elements in a sequence, with slicing being a more versatile concept that includes indexing as a special case."
