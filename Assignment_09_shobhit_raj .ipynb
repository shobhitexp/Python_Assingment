        "Answer :- In Python, a relative path refers to the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory of the Python script being executed. It allows you to navigate and access files within the same project or directory structure without relying on fixed absolute paths. Python's os.path and pathlib modules provide functions and classes to handle relative paths.\n",

        "In Python, an absolute path in the context of the operating system typically starts with the root directory symbol, which is represented by a forward slash ('/') on Unix-based systems (such as Linux and macOS) or a drive letter followed by a colon (e.g., 'C:') on Windows. It provides the full path from the root directory to a specific file or directory location, regardless of the current working directory. Python's os.path and pathlib modules allow you to manipulate and work with absolute paths in a cross-platform manner.\n",

However, unlike regular dictionaries that store data in memory, a shelf value is stored on disk, providing persistence across multiple program executions. It is useful for caching data, saving program state, or storing intermediate results.\n",
