They allow you to perform tasks such as pattern matching, text extraction, and text replacement efficiently. Regular expressions are versatile and widely used in tasks like data validation, text processing, and web scraping.\n",

This is important because raw strings do not escape backslashes, which is crucial when dealing with regular expression metacharacters. In replacement strings, using the raw-string indicator is not necessary unless you want to avoid escaping backslashes in the replacement text, making the replacement string easier to read and less error-prone."
